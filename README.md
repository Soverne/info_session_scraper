# Info session scraper

This script will get the calendar listings from the employee info session calendar at http://www.ceca.uwaterloo.ca/students/sessions.php and paste it all into one long .txt file for your browsing pleasure. Change the months and year as required for accurate scraping. There will be a few empty dates depending on the month and the way that jobmine structures their ID's. I apologize for leaving them in but it was not worth the effort to fix in code.
